# word_guess_game

Developer: Samantha Orcutt

game layout:
For the layout I used bootstrap to put different elements into containers for a clean resizable layout. Minor adjustments like text and color have been changed in the CSS file but most layout is configured int HTML with bootstrap. 

game content: The game content is fairly simple it is all in HTML and is basically wins, losses, letters guessed, and blanks. The complex part is the next bit in where the javascript actually goes through how the game is run.
